# Marlin Firmware for Anycubic Kossel

This is an attempt to create a simple configuration for as many different
Anycubic Kossel variants as possible. This will always be a work in progress.
Based on the original idea EasyConfig of terryb58 and JimBrown for the
Tevo Tarantula.

Do not use the configuration files in the main Marlin folder. Copy the
configuration files from the "example configurations/delta/ANYCUBIC" folder.

Open configuration.h file in a text editor and make the changes at the top
section of the file. You should not have to make any other changes.

Do you have a configuration for your Kossel that is not covered in the
Configuration.h file? Would you like to share it with others? If so, please
open an issue, or create a pull request :D

Thanks!
